##BIT MANIPULATION

This project is intended to help us understand different data representations while we develop our skill of tackling problems in c

#FUNCTIONS

0-binary_to_uint.c 
	converts binary numbers to unsigned integer
1-print_binary.c
	prints binary representation of integers
2-get_bit.c
	gets the bit at hte specified index
3-set_bit.c
	set the bit of an integer to 1 at specified index
4-clear_bit.c
	sets the bit of an integer to 0 at specified index
5-flip_bits.c
	returns the number of bits you need to flip to get from one number to another
